# Notes

## Impero Calculus Updates
* Define a new `impero_operators(...)` function
* Define a scalar / vector field struct to wrap MPIStateArrays in sets of 3 for vector gradient

## ImperoHooks on CLIMA
* Modify ImperoHooks branch on CLIMA to use ImperoHooks with appropriate tutorials
* Add tutorials on Grid structure, Impero domain object

## Math side (using Exasim model)
* Full mass matrix and over-integration
* Non-Cartesian bases for vector fields
	* Need appropriate coordinate transform to new basis
	* Tricky for components orthogonal to radial directions
* Fully implicit timestepping
	* Potential look into pre-conditioners (Exasim)

## Physics side
* Build simply heat equation model with BC
* Redo vector calculus test in CLIMA

## Software engineering side
* Specifying BC
* Specifying timestepping methods
	* Are there too many timestepping methods in CLIMA? The world may never know!
* Kernel fusion via symbolic manipulation
	* Just contact James
